            Amiria and Ena are two ghost-hunting best friends. While most 12
            year olds are at the mall, these two explore haunted houses and
            spooky graveyards! Amiria is a science geek who wants to prove
            ghosts are real, while Ena is the town’s resident goth who loves
            all things occult. Together, they combine tech and magic to
