      <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>Fortress Technology, a global leader in manufacturing inspection equipment, needed to transform its digital presence. 
          Their existing website was fragmented, outdated, and failed to reflect their reputation as an industry innovator. 
          I was the lead UX Designer for the redesign of their global website.
        </br></br>
          My role was to ensure the new platform was built on a foundation of user-centric principles and translated Fortress's business goals. 
          This included enhancing the user journey, improving lead generation, and creating a scalable multilingual platformâ€”all within a meaningful
          and effective digital experience.

          </svg>&nbsp;Outcomes</h4>
      <h2>A Seamless User Experience To Grow New Customers and Impress Long-Term Partners</h2>
      <p>
        The new website is projected to launch in January 2026. The final product is a modern website that aligns with Fortress Technology's 
        reputation for excellence. It provides a vastly improved user experience, making it easier for customers to find solutions and connect 
        with the company. By focusing on clear navigation and valuable content, the new site is poised to significantly increase qualified leads, 
        improve SEO performance, and strengthen the Fortress brand across all its global markets.

      Personally, I learned how important it is to stay agile as new requests and roadblocks appear during a project. This was a lean UX project, 
      with minimal hours to address such a large web build. I hit the ground running along with the client to turn around key deliverables week by week.
